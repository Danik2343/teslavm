TeslaVM is graphical user interface made for QEMU for windows usage, since only linux have well working GUI interface for QEMU and its kinda hard and not practical to use so i thought that i can make a program like virt-manager.

## Todo
- [ ]  Windows 64bit support
- [ ]  Save and select more than one machine (machine list like virtualbox,vmware)
- [ ]  Improve frontend
- [ ]  Select cpu and machine type
- [ ]  ARM virtualization (will be much better than other virtual machine software)
- [ ]  Guest sound to host
- [ ]  Internal virtual network
- [ ]  NAT, Bridged etc. selection of network mode 
- [ ]  Create virtual disk from app
- [ ]  Select CD-ROM, virtual disk instead of typing the path
- [ ]  Selection between VNC and default QEMU window
- [ ]  USB, BT passtrough 
and much more...
## FAQ

#### Does it support machine acceleration and graphics acceleration?

&nbsp;Yes it does on AMD and Intel CPU's with Linux, partially with Windows

#### What guest OS does it support?

&nbsp;Any linux distro 32bit/64bit and Windows (currently only 32bit)

#### Will it support more machines to save than only one?

&nbsp;Yes, we are planning to rework the GUI. We are currently working more on the backend than the frontend.

#### Will it fully support windows?

&nbsp;Currently Windows support is poor (only 32 bit, poor acceleration but it's ok) but we are going to improve it

#### HAX acceleration makes my machines doesnt launch! ðŸ˜ 

&nbsp;Probably you dont have [HAXM](https://github.com/intel/haxm/releases/tag/v7.7.1) or you have Hyper-V [enabled](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/uninstalling-or-disabling-hyper-v-in-windows-10/).

#### I cant launch machine with Hyper-V acceleration ðŸ˜¡
&nbsp;You have to [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) Hyper-V.

#### I cant even launch a VM ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
&nbsp;Bro. You should check if your CPU supports VT-d/VT-x and if does, check if you have virtualization options enabled in BIOS.
